          <h2> Follow a Healthy Routine</h2>
          <p>
            Having a routine is the best way to promote health and wellness.
            Routine helps students to better organise their time and make room
            for healthy habits

          <h2>Eat a Healthy Diet</h2>
          <p>
            Diet plays a very important role in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
            Students should keep healthy snacks readily available – in between
            the break during studies. Peanuts, fox nuts and coconut water are
            healthier alternatives to salt-laden chips and carbonated sugary
            drinks.

        <div className="tip">
          <h2>Timely Meals</h2>
          <p>
            Timely meals help students maintain a scheduled and organised life.
            Late night dinner or eating junk food for dinner may create
            digestion issues.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="tip">
          <h2> Drink Plenty of Water</h2>
          <p>
            It is important for students to keep themselves hydrated. Brain
            activities are strongly related to hydration level status. Studies
            show that even 2-3% dehydration of body weight can impair many
            aspects of brain function.

        <div className="tip">
          <h2>Regular Exercise</h2>
          <p>
            Physical activities are not just good for physical well-being but
            they are also good for mental well-being. Physical activity helps in
            releasing feel-good hormones that help in regulating mood.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="tip">
          <h2>Enough Sleep</h2>
          <p>
            Good sleep is very important to keep the students fresh, relaxed and
            helps them focus more on their academics. Staying up late should be
            only for urgent needs otherwise, timely sleep is essential to
            maintain a healthy lifestyle. Ideally, a student should sleep for
            7-8 hours.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="tip">
          <h2>Manage Stress</h2>
          <p>
            Academic pressure, peer pressure and other factors can make students
            feel stressed. Chronic stress can take a toll on the physical and
            mental health of students. It can also lead to sleep issues among
            students. They can add stress-relieving exercises such as yoga and
            meditation to their daily routine.
          </p>

          <h2>Try to be Organised</h2>
          <p>
            Organised behaviour helps them to lead a balanced life, helps
            students to prioritise things so that they do not get anxious at the
            last minute. They can further take out time for extracurricular
            activities to maintain a balance between academics and co-curricular
            activities.
